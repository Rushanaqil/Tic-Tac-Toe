# TIC TAC TOE

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## Introduction

Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os, is a classic paper-and-pencil game for two players. The game is traditionally played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a square in the grid with their symbol (X or O). The objective of the game is to be the first player to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This Tic Tac Toe game allows two players to play against each other in a digital format. The game is built using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game logic.
